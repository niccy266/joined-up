# joined-up

A program to search for the shortest overlapping chain between two words in a dictionary. 

Two words are linked if they have n overlapping letters. E.g. if n is 3, then the words "master" and "termite" are linked by the overlap "ter".

I tried a few approaches in python to come up with an efficient solution before translating it into java to run faster.

The final solution is Joined.java
